Download Demographic_Statistics_By_Zip_Code.csv.

Write a Python script (via Jupyter notebook, as usual) that imports this file into a pandas dataframe, cleans it up if necessary, and performs the following analysis on it.

Find the proportion of surveyed people who are female, in total.

Find the zip code with the highest proportion of people of Pacific Islander ethnicity and report the number of respondents from that zip code.

Using each zip code as a data point, perform a linear regression to see if there's a simple linear relation between the proportion of respondents who are citizens and the proportion receiving public assistance.

Record the results of your analysis in a text portion of the Jupyter notebook.
